1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,080
It's easy to get into home roasting

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,200
though, right?Because you can do that on

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,560
anything. I mean, you can really do it

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,600
with a frying pan.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,640
It is an immensely labor-intensive

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,960
process to grow coffee.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,240
So we started this three years and two

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:16,800
days ago.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,080
This is the seed of a cherry.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,200
Mycotoxins are toxins that are produced

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,080
by yeast and fungi. So

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,160
I I leased this roaster from higher

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,920
grounds, really dialing in a roast

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
and really being able to execute it the

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,160
way I want it.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,760
You don't want to do this really fast,

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,760
because most of the coffee in the rest of

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,800
the world is all bread from a tiny

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
handful of beans. My name's Luke

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,1000
Cizek, and I'm the founder and roaster at

21
00:00:55,1000 --> 00:00:56,640
Lab Notes Coffee.

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,680
The coffee originated in Ethiopia. It's

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,200
since been spread, you know, throughout

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,400
the whole world. But originally a lot of

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,480
European countries, I want to say like

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,120
the Dutch and the French really started

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,800
like exporting coffee out of Ethiopia

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,720
into Europe. But they really wanted to

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,800
maintain their monopoly and not let other

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,760
people grow coffee. So there were export

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,560
rules saying all the beans had to be

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,880
boiled before they left the country so

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,920
that nobody could actually use the plant

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,280
these seeds and and grow their own

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,920
coffee. Most of the

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
coffee that's available in countries

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,760
outside of Africa are all

38
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,560
descendants from literally one handful of

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,520
coffee that a Dutch person

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,760
smuggled out in the 1500s. I believe it

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,760
was 1500s, somewhere around there. And at

42
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,360
the time, you know, doing so, I believe

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,120
the penalty was death. Like you could get

44
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,080
killed for smuggling out

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,520
unboiled coffee. It

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,280
is an immensely labor intensive process

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,760
to grow coffee, right?The cherries,

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,960
generally speaking, are picked by hand

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,240
when ripe. Every cherry has two coffee

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,400
beans in it. So think about how many

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,080
coffee beans go into your One Cup of

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,240
coffee that you drink in the morning. So,

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,440
so much work goes into growing that

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,280
plant, picking all of the cherries, then

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,120
processing the cherries and ending with a

56
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,720
green coffee that someone can roast and.

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,520
And I think just general awareness about

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
that is important. People need to realize

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,560
that that the people growing the coffee

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,120
are the ones really doing all the work.

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,160
You know, think about anything else you

62
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,480
buy and how much, how big it is and how

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,400
much it costs you. To be able to get a

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,760
pound of green coffee for under $2,

65
00:02:41,1000 --> 00:02:42,560
that's wild.

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,080
This is the seed of a cherry. So there's

67
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,1000
a whole process for getting the beans

68
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,840
out of the cherry. There's naturally

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,320
processed, which historically has been my

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,640
my favorite. You're less likely to have

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,440
bad things happen, like the coffee end up

72
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,360
with a bunch of mycotoxins. So mycotoxins

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,880
are toxins that are produced by yeast and

74
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,360
fungi. Some of the like stated effects of

75
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,440
those include things like jitteriness,

76
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,560
stuff that people actually attribute to

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,480
to caffeine. And these are things that

78
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,480
are are going to be more prominent in

79
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,240
those cheaper coffees, right?Where the

80
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,400
they really are not processed well in

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,360
terms of what happens after harvesting.

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,640
They're not good for your body. They

83
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,200
don't make you feel good. They don't add

84
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,480
to your coffee drinking experience is the

85
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,320
type of coffee where you drink a lot of

86
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,120
it and it makes you feel kind of tired

87
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
and you wonder what's wrong with this

88
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,520
coffee. And then like 6 hours later,

89
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,720
you're like, oh yeah, I'm awake and like

90
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm not going to be able to sleep

91
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
tonight. Guess there was caffeine in

92
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
there after all. But the way you

93
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
feel right out of the gate is,

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,960
I believe, a good indicator of whether or

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
not mycotoxin.

96
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,720
I think I sort of feel like coffee right

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,520
now is going through what beer did, you

98
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,360
know, a few, a decade or a few decades

99
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,400
ago. I feel like there's always more

100
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,160
room. Granted, the the roasters seem to

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,160
be getting smaller and smaller, but I

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
think that's really awesome. So there's,

103
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,080
you know, a handful of local roasters. I

104
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,200
love to drink all their coffees and I'm

105
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,680
really glad they all exist. I think it's

106
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,680
a lot of fun to to try other people's

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,600
coffees. So from my point of view, there

108
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
is a lot of room. I guess if your goal is

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
world domination, you know, there's

110
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
there's already a lot of really big

111
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
coffee companies out there. So you got to

112
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,800
really bring something unique if you're

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,760
going to take over. But it's neat that

114
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
the coffee roasting world is slowly

115
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,760
becoming more and more collaborative.

116
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,440
Whereas before it was all super

117
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
secretive, people didn't want to talk

118
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
about how they roasted or share roast

119
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,280
profiles or really get into the details

120
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,840
of, you know, their personal beliefs on

121
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,280
roasting theory. It's all like a hidden

122
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,880
black box of this is our our proprietary

123
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,080
thing and we're not going to tell anybody

124
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,320
about it. So I think it's really cool

125
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,640
that, you know, that people are talking

126
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,160
about it more openly. I think even if

127
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
you're doing something that works really

128
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,560
well, it it's why not share that with

129
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
other people and let them try to do that

130
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,800
too. Really elevate, you know, all of the

131
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,280
coffee if you really think what you're

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,200
doing is is the best way to do it.

133
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,880
So I have a full-time job that I do

134
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,1000
normally and that's really what pays our

135
00:05:37,1000 --> 00:05:40,480
bills. We do this because we love doing

136
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,200
it. So we started this three

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,080
years and two days ago was our our

138
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,800
launch date. So we've done this in a

139
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,720
really like low capital expenditure

140
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,480
way, right. We we lease time on somebody

141
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,400
else's roaster. We've actually been able

142
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,280
to keep our expenses low enough that

143
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,160
we can keep our purchases on

144
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
0 interest introductory APR credit

145
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,560
cards and pay them off and open a new one

146
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,160
as needed. And so far that has

147
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,760
worked 100% for us. And

148
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,120
we know that won't work forever and that

149
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,360
at some point we'll actually take out a

150
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,080
business loan. But it's been really,

151
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,400
really helpful for kind of getting our

152
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,240
foot in the door. So I was a

153
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,480
patron here for years before I ever even

154
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,080
thought of starting a coffee company or

155
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,240
trying to see if I could lease time on

156
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,840
this particular roaster. So roasters are

157
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,440
really, really expensive relative to what

158
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,640
they make. So there's a small roaster. I

159
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,280
roast 5 pounds at a time on it. A used

160
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,440
roaster like this is like $15,000.

161
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,560
Margins in coffee are pretty small, so it

162
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,520
really take a long time to pay that off.

163
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,480
And it also requires a commercial space

164
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,200
to operate it in. So having no roaster or

165
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,360
space for the roaster, leasing really

166
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,040
worked out well. Initially we thought

167
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,560
maybe at some point we'd buy a roaster

168
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,520
and operate it out of our house. The more

169
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,840
I learned about all of this, the less

170
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,320
likely I think that actually is that

171
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,760
we'll be able to get the right permitting

172
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,240
for a bigger roaster on a residence. It's

173
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,1000
easy to get into home roasting though,

174
00:07:05,1000 --> 00:07:07,040
right?Because you can do that on

175
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,400
anything. I mean, you can really do it

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,1000
with a frying pan. You can get a $30

177
00:07:10,1000 --> 00:07:13,760
popcorn popper and you can use that.

178
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,1000
The home roaster I used for my sample

179
00:07:15,1000 --> 00:07:18,240
roasting was about $400. So again, it's

180
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,200
is a hobby. It's very, it's something you

181
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,640
can really get into pretty easily.

182
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,1000
This computer makes its own graph, but

183
00:08:22,1000 --> 00:08:24,760
there's no way that I'm aware of at least

184
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,080
to get the data out of this graph. So

185
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,760
every 30 seconds I record the

186
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,640
temperature, rate of change, total amount

187
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
of time. And then lastly, the final

188
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
temperature all play a role. So this

189
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,800
orange line is the temperature change

190
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,040
overtime. Blue line is the actual

191
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,840
temperature of the beans. Getting there

192
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,360
in 11 verse 15 minutes will affect the

193
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,320
roast. So I just entered the temperatures

194
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,320
and it outputs a rate of rise in degrees

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,720
per minute. The amount of time you spend

196
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,480
in the last 10 degrees will dramatically

197
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,200
affect the roast. And this is the type of

198
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
curve that we're shooting for where it

199
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,320
peaks relatively early and then we have a

200
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,720
continuous decline after that point. A

201
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,440
different ending temperature of 1 degree.

202
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,280
You can taste that. It would be so much

203
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,320
harder to do stuff consistently

204
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,1000
if I wasn't taking the time to do it on

205
00:09:13,1000 --> 00:09:16,520
this computer. Over

206
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,480
roasting is much more common in terms

207
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,800
of the whole world of coffee. There's a

208
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,640
lot of coffee companies whose lightest

209
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,640
coffee is darker than our darkest coffee.

210
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
If that's the cup of coffee you like,

211
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,560
that's I have no problem with that. But

212
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,320
for me that. I now see those as really

213
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,840
not showing the true flavor of the coffee

214
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,240
and really just having like a lot of

215
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,240
roasty or ashy flavors. And

216
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,640
a lot of people are kind of brought into

217
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,040
coffee thinking that's what it's supposed

218
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
to be, you know, like. Like in a a

219
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
century class at a culinary school, they

220
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,120
will teach you bitter with coffee. Like

221
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,240
coffee is your example for bitter. But

222
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,520
it's amazing. I mean, there is really

223
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,080
just about any fruit and berry you can

224
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,720
imagine. And there's a lot of chocolatey

225
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,600
flavors. There can be buttery and

226
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,640
caramelly flavors. There can be earthy

227
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
flavors. There can be different types of

228
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,520
spiced flavors in there. You can detect

229
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,240
as a nuanced flavor in a brewed

230
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,400
coffee that is literally just coffee. So

231
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
we're gonna brew some coffee in a French

232
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,080
press. First step is

233
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
grinding it at the right size. This is

234
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,640
just the regular Capresso coffee grinder

235
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
that you can buy for your house. I like

236
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,800
to use the quart, the finest of the

237
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,440
coarse grind sizes. Generally

238
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,1000
speaking, for French press and cold brew,

239
00:10:29,1000 --> 00:10:31,760
you want to go with a coarse grind.

240
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,800
For any new coffee I brew, I always start

241
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,520
with a water to coffee ratio of

242
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,680
16 to one by weight. I always weigh

243
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,760
everything. If you can weigh everything,

244
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,840
you'll be able to make the most

245
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,240
consistent cup of coffee. So for a normal

246
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,840
French press, just any French press you

247
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,280
would buy at a store, you can generally

248
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,880
brew 880 grams of

249
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,640
water. It's just a little bit less than a

250
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,120
liter. For that, I'll

251
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,840
use

252
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,760
55 grams of coffee.

253
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,1000
I always like to use water that's 200

254
00:11:08,1000 --> 00:11:11,360
degrees Fahrenheit. Some people like to

255
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,240
go up to 205 or as low as 195. I

256
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
feel like 200 is is the perfect starting

257
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,760
temperature to use. So I target a total

258
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,840
brew time in a French press of five

259
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
minutes. When I'm adding the water this

260
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,440
way through a relatively slow pour

261
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,920
kettle, that means I'll set a timer once

262
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,520
I'm done adding the water for four

263
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,400
minutes. If I was using a different

264
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,240
kettle that adds the water all at once

265
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,760
real quick, I would set the timer for

266
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,440
five minutes. And usually about halfway

267
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,240
through, I'll stop and just kind of

268
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,680
swirl the coffee, make sure all the

269
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,320
grounds are saturated. Now set a timer

270
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,040
for four minutes.

271
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,840
All right, time to press the coffee.

272
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,360
You don't want to do this really

273
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
fast. That extra pressure will

274
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,960
extract more out of the coffee, generally

275
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,560
in a bad way.

276
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
I would encourage everybody to pursue

277
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,760
their passion. What is what is it that's

278
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,120
easier to do besides what you're

279
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
interested in, right. So, so if there's

280
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,640
something you're interested in that,

281
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
yeah, you should look into how you can

282
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,560
work that into your life. And there's

283
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,040
usually a way to do it regardless of your

284
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,840
situation, right. And to use our coffee

285
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,880
situation as the example, you know, not

286
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,840
having to buy a coffee shop or

287
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,1000
buy a roaster in order to even start a

288
00:12:29,1000 --> 00:12:31,760
company and it and it didn't start it

289
00:12:31,1000 --> 00:12:33,520
starting a company, you know, it started

290
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,960
it. I just would like to roast more

291
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,960
coffee. and doing a lot of roasting

292
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,840
at home. Anybody who, I guess, feels like

293
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,720
they can't pursue those things that they

294
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,1000
they really want to do, I would challenge

295
00:12:44,1000 --> 00:12:46,800
them to to look at it differently and

296
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,480
find a way. I think I think there's

297
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,080
always a way to be able to make it

298
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,640
happen. So we're going to make a pour

299
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,680
over in a Chemex.

300
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
While the coffee is grinding, you can wet

301
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,680
out your filter. That way you don't have

302
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,840
any dry spots where water will not flow

303
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,360
through and extract through the coffee

304
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,240
properly. First step is to do a

305
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
bloom with the coffee, do an initial

306
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,040
wetting out of the grounds and let

307
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,720
everything become saturated in water.

308
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,520
General rule of thumb is to use three

309
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,680
times the mass of water is the mass of

310
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
beans you have, so it's three times the

311
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,160
weight of that 40 grams of coffee the

312
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,480
bloom will. Actually give you a sweeter

313
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
coffee. It'll give you a better

314
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,080
extraction. So what's happening now is

315
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,920
all the grounds are becoming saturated

316
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,080
with that initial water and there's some

317
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,680
initial like off gassing that is

318
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
happening from the beans. The idea for

319
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,800
this is to pour near the center. You

320
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,520
don't want to pour around the outer edge.

321
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,240
Pouring around the outer edge will cause

322
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,560
the water to kind of bypass your grounds

323
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,440
and just go straight into the bottom of

324
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,160
the vessel. You don't want to fill it up

325
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,680
all the way simultaneously. You don't

326
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,360
want to let it dry out entirely. So I'll

327
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,800
continue to add water and little pulses

328
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,880
like this till we get to 640 grams.

329
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,680
Really dialing in a roast and really

330
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
being able to execute it the way I want

331
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,680
it, right?So there's just that like

332
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,400
personal satisfaction there with it going

333
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,640
the way I want. But then feedback from

334
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,720
people is a huge piece too. Like the

335
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
making something that other people enjoy

336
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,640
is. I like a lot more than I

337
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,440
would have guessed. That That really

338
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
does bring me a lot of joy. Just being

339
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,680
able to do something that I love and for

340
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,560
it to also be something someone else

341
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,520
really loves is is

342
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,400
my favorite part of it.
